Margin calculator
In business, the &quot;margin&quot; is calculated as the percentage difference between
&quot;revenue&quot; and &quot;cost of goods&quot; (COGS), for example if costs are £400, and revenue
is £500, then the margin is 20% (i.e. £100 is 20% of £500)
Implement the following:

```
import java.math.BigDecimal;

public interface RevenueCalculator { 
    BigDecimal
